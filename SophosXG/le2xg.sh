ROUTER=IP-ADRESS:4444

# the system where the LetsEncrypt is running
#
# 1. the 'admin' account has full api access,
#    or you can create a dedicated api user
# 2. 'api' access must be enabled at
#    Administration -> Backup & Firmware -> API
#      - Enable 'API Configuration'
#      - enter the IP addresses that should be allowed to access the API
APIUSER=api-acme
APIPLAINPASS=PASSWORD

# Complete path to xgxml.txt
XML=./xgxml.txt

# Letsencrypt domain
# look in /root/.acme.sh/
LEDOMAIN=DOMAIN.de

# Letsencrypt CertificateAuthority
# CA will be created in Sophos as ${LECertAuth}-yyyymmdd
LECertAuth=LetsEncrypt-CA

# cert date
CERTDATE=$(find /root/.acme.sh/${LEDOMAIN}/${LEDOMAIN}.key -printf "%CY%Cm%Cd\n")

# XG Operation
#     add: this must be used once to initiate the certificate on the XG
#  update: this is used for updating the cert once it has been created
OPERATION=${1:-add}

# Overview -
# 1. copy & rename letsencrypt 'privkey.pem' to 'privkey.key'
# 2. replace placeholder variables in 'xgxml.txt' with values above
# 3. feed the result to curl
#    - listing the 3 files to be uploaded in the order they occur in the input
# 4. Delete the copy of privkey.pem that was created
